      <p id="interesting-fact">The word "kulan" comes from the Mongolian language and translates as "invincible, fast, nimble."</p>
      <ul id="facts">
        <li>
          <span class="facts">Kulan</span>: <em>Dzhegetay (lat. Equus hemionus) - a species from the equine family.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="facts">Kulan sizes</span>: <em>The length of the body of the kulan is 175-200 cm, the length of the tail is about 40 cm, the height at the shoulder level (at the withers) is 125 cm, and the weight is 120-300 kg.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="facts">Unlike a horse</span>:  <em>The head is more massive with long auricles (from 17 to 25 cm) and thinner legs with narrow, elongated hooves. The hairline in the summer is short, tight to the skin, in winter the hair is longer and curvy. On the upper side of the neck there is a short, upright mane that extends from the auricles to the withers; "Bangs" characteristic of a domestic horse, no. The tail is short, thin, with a tuft of long hair in the lower third.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="facts">Habitat</span>: <em>Distributed in Iran, Afghanistan, Mongolia, Northwest China. Lives in the semi-deserts of Central Asia</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p id="summary">Outwardly, it very much resembles a donkey, but has many common signs with a horse, which is why the kulan is often called a half-donkey. The generic name is lat. hemionus - from other Greek ἡμίονος, literally "half-settled," that is, a mule or hinnies. It is believed that the kulan was never tame, unlike the African donkey.
        The general tone of the body, neck and head is sand-yellow in various shades and saturations, sometimes reaching a reddish-brown with a grayish tint. A narrow dark stripe runs along the midline of the back and tail. The mane and ends of the ears are dark brown. Long hair at the end of the tail is black or black-brown. The bottom of the trunk and neck, the end of the head, the internal parts of the limbs and the area near the tail are light, almost white.
